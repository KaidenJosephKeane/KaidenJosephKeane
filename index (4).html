<h2>Habitat & Natural environment</h>

<h4>Cats are extremely flexible and may thrive in a variety of conditions. Many live indoors as pets, while others find homes on farms or in cities, where they may wander and hunt. Stray and feral cats frequently seek shelter or form colonies in the wild. Cats, regardless of their location, automatically seek out safe, comfortable places to relax and explore their environment.
