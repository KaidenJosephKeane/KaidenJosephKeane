<h2>Habitat & Natural environment</h>

<p id="Habitat">Cats are extremely flexible and may thrive in a variety of conditions. Many live indoors as pets, while others find homes on farms or in cities, where they may wander and hunt. Stray and feral cats frequently seek shelter or form colonies in the wild. Cats, regardless of their location, automatically seek out safe, comfortable places to relax and explore their environment.

    <h2>Diet</h2>
   
<p id="Habitat">A cat's diet should consist of a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and amino acids. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they need to eat meat to get the nutrients they need to stay healthy

<h3>Behavior</h3>
<p id="Habitat">Domestic and large cats are playful. Domestic cats engage in activities such as pouncing and chasing toys, which are beneficial to their physical and mental health and help them form stronger attachments with their owners. Similarly, huge cats like lions and tigers play to improve their hunting skills and social relationships, with newborn cubs especially playful. Even adult big cats exhibit playful behavior in protected venues such as sanctuaries and zoos. Overall, play is crucial for the health of all cats.
